The folder sphinx_docs contains functionality to extract source code documentation with sphinx, currently only 
covering the packages data_processing and protein_score_utilities. The source folder contains all the configuration 
files (like core.py), while a build folder will be generated and updated when the make file in this folder is executed.

Note that the configuration will need to follow the setup described [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). Also,
in order to run the make script the make functionality will have to be installed as well as the python and the sphinx 
package for python.
