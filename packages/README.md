This project contains multiple packages that can be used individually or joined together. For examples on how to use 
the packages, see the Python code in the scripts folder of the repository. More dedicated examples for each package 
are to follow in due time.

All packages are structured similarly and contain their own tests and release option. Each package needs to be 
installed as part of the environment to use its functionality. To install a package use the following command from
the root directory of the repository (where <package_name> is to be replaced with the respective package name):

pip install -e ./packages/<package_name>/

For a specification of what functionality individual packages provide, please the README files of the individual 
packages.
