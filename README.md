This project aims to extract protein information for diseases and rank extracted 
protein with respect to their relevance for the disease. This ranking is based
on semantic concepts that are also extracted and clustered from publication
abstracts. The work was initiated based on the publication:

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233956

Note that the repository is currently under development and therefore some
features do not exist yet or are implement in a rudimentary fashion. To provide
feedback, please use the issue tracker of the repository -- thanks.
